# Requirements Specification

## Overview

The system consists of two main components that need to be integrated:

1. Eliza - An AI agent platform that handles LLM interactions and various integrations
2. VSCode Extension - A client interface that connects to Eliza for AI capabilities

## 1. Architecture Requirements

### Integration Architecture

- VSCode extension must not communicate directly with LLMs
- All AI interactions must be routed through an Eliza agent
- Communication between VSCode extension and Eliza should be via secure API endpoints
- The extension should support configuration of Eliza endpoint URLs and authentication

### Security Requirements

- Secure authentication between VSCode extension and Eliza agent
- Encryption of all data in transit
- Secure storage of credentials and tokens
- Rate limiting and request validation

## 2. Eliza Agent Requirements

### API Endpoints

- Must provide REST API endpoints for:
  - Agent initialization and authentication
  - Message sending and receiving
  - Stream support for real-time responses
  - Status and health checks
  - Configuration management

### Features

- Support for VSCode-specific context handling
- Ability to process code-related queries
- Support for streaming responses
- Session management
- Error handling and recovery
- Logging and monitoring capabilities

## 3. VSCode Extension Requirements

### User Interface

- Clean and intuitive chat interface using webview
- Code-aware context menu integration
- Status indicators for agent connection
- Progress indicators for ongoing operations
- Error and status messages

### Features

- Connect to configured Eliza agent
- Send messages and receive responses
- Support for code snippets and file context
- Stream response display
- Command palette integration
- Settings management
- Error handling and retry logic

### Configuration

- Eliza agent endpoint URL
- Authentication credentials/tokens
- Response display preferences
- Keyboard shortcuts
- Auto-start options

## 4. Performance Requirements

- Maximum response time for initial connection: 2 seconds
- Maximum latency for message round-trip: 1 second
- Smooth streaming of responses
- Minimal impact on VSCode performance
- Efficient memory usage

## 5. Development Requirements

### VSCode Extension

- TypeScript/JavaScript implementation
- Use of VSCode extension API best practices
- Comprehensive testing suite
- Error telemetry
- Documentation for users and developers

### Integration Testing

- End-to-end testing of extension with Eliza agent
- Performance testing
- Security testing
- Error condition testing

## 6. Documentation Requirements

### User Documentation

- Installation instructions
- Configuration guide
- Usage examples
- Troubleshooting guide
- FAQ

### Developer Documentation

- Architecture overview
- API documentation
- Setup instructions
- Contributing guidelines
- Testing procedures

## 7. Future Considerations

- Support for multiple concurrent Eliza agents
- Offline mode capabilities
- Custom UI themes
- Extension API for other VSCode extensions
- Integration with version control systems

## 8. Success Criteria

- Successful integration between VSCode extension and Eliza agent
- Response times within specified limits
- Positive user feedback
- Stable operation under various conditions
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Clear and complete documentation
